# Pharmaceutical prediction 

In this project, we are given a set of data that we are going to use to create a time series analysis so that 
we can predict the sales that the company can make in the next week. 

# The steps we are going to use in this Project are as follows

## Import the data

Here we are to use a app_loger function to get the data that we want. 

## Expore the data through EDA

## create a model for the time series analysis

## Make the final prediction of the sales for one week
